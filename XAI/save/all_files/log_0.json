Option A is incorrect because some students may eat from the canteen and save money or not get sick. Option C is a possibility because some students might not eat from the canteen at all.

Since we have identified a student (from premise P3) who eats from the canteen, it follows logically that this student is careful with food at the canteen and therefore saves money on meals."

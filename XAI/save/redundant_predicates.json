Your task is to:\n        1. Identify any redundant predicates that can be expressed using another more general (overall) predicate.\n        2. Replace those redundant predicates with expressions that use one or two general predicates, while preserving their original meaning.\n            - Example: PredicateA(args) is redundant because it is equivalent to PredicateB(args); replace PredicateA(args) ⇒ PredicateB(args)\n            - Or Example: PredicateA(args) is redundant because it is equivalent the combination of PredicateB(args) and PredicateC(args) using logical conjunction ∧; replace PredicateA(args) ⇒ PredicateB(args) ∧ PredicateB(args)\n        \n        Only remove a predicate if it is fully expressible using other predicate and does not carry unique semantic value.\n        1. Redundant predicates identified and replaced.\n        2. General predicate derived from list predicate.\n        3. Always check if the replaced predicate definition can be express by the new predicate ones.\n        4. Keep the main predicates that has important role. These main predicate has role such as:  (1 predicate per role is kept).\n        5. Do not give explanation\n        6. If predicate can be replace by two another predicates, some logical conjunction can be used is: ∧ (and), ∨ (or).\n        [RESPONSE]\n\n        \n\n        ### Output\n        \"List Redundant

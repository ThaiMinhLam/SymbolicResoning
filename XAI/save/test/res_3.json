Premise 9’s research methodology and premise 2 make her eligible for the international program. Premise 10’s capstone project and premise 4 award her an honors diploma. Premise 11’s community service and premise 5 qualify her for the university scholarship, supporting option A. Option B is false because community service suffices without a recommendation. Option C is true but weaker than A, as scholarship implies prior eligibility. Option D is false because language proficiency is not required via premise 2’s path.",
            "The university scholarship per premise 5 requires an honors diploma and community service. Premise 4 requires international program eligibility and a capstone project, premise 2 requires advanced course qualification and research methodology, and premise 1 requires core curriculum and science assessment. Premises 7–11 confirm Sophia’s curriculum, assessment, methodology, capstone, and service, satisfying all conditions for the scholarship."

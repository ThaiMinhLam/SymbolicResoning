Premise 7’s three or more publications and premise 3 qualify him for curriculum committees. Premise 8’s positive evaluation and premise 4 confirm he can propose new courses, supporting option C. Option A is false because he can supervise graduates. Option B is false because he can propose courses. Option D is false because he has sufficient publications.",

Premise 3 requires graduate supervision and at least three publications, premise 2 requires undergraduate teaching and a PhD, and premise 1 requires training. Premises 5–8 confirm John’s training, PhD, publications, and evaluation, satisfying all conditions, so he meets the requirements."

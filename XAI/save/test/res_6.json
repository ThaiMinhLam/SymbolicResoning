            "Professor John has taught for at least 5 years (Premise 5), so he is eligible for extended library access (by Premise 1). Because he has at least one publication (Premise 6), he can access restricted archives (Premise 2). With completed ethics training (Premise 7), he can submit research proposals (Premise 3), and with departmental endorsement (Premise 8), he can apply for collaborative research projects (Premise 4). Hence, option B is logically valid.",
            "Yes, all conditions in the logical sequence are fulfilled in order: teaching experience leads to extended access, which, with a publication, allows access to archives. Adding ethics training enables proposal submission, and endorsement completes the criteria for collaborative project application. The reasoning is valid and consistent."

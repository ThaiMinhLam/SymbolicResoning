However, premise 6 confirms hazmat training, but premise 7 states he lacks a safety endorsement, so premise 2 prevents him from transporting hazardous materials, supporting option C. Option A is false because he cannot transport hazardous materials. Option B is false because he cannot cross state lines without hazardous material capability. Option D is false because he can transport standard goods.",
            "Crossing state lines with hazardous cargo per premise 3 requires the ability to transport hazardous materials and an interstate permit. Premise 2 requires standard goods capability, hazmat training, and a safety endorsement for hazardous materials. Premises 1, 4, 5, and 6 confirm standard goods and training, and premise 8 confirms the permit, but premise 7’s lack of endorsement prevents hazardous material transport, so John does not meet all requirements."

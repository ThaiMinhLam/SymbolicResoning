Your task is to understand and answer questions based on events and rules that happen in an educational setting. The dataset contains simple, rule-based statements (like course completions, enrollments, and eligibility) and facts about individuals (like students).\\n        Your job is to:\\n        - The event must include both verb and object related to that event (submit a form → submit_form)\\n        - Identify logical relationships between events (e.g., \"If A, then B\"),\\n        - Track facts about entities (like what courses David completed),\\n        - Infer new facts by chaining rules together (e.g., if David completed_A and passed_B, then he may be David eligible_for_something),\\n        - Keep all names and objects consistent (do not rename),\\n        Avoid subject-specific knowledge—the task is about reasoning in an educational context, not teaching content.\\n    \\n        ', '\\n        Please simplify the following logic problem statement and convert it into a \"Simplified Statement\" with \"List Objects\", \"List Actions\" and \"List Instances\" corresponding to its \"Simplified Statement\". \\n            - Each Statement is seperated by dot formula \".\". \\n            - Extract the core information from each statement and present its logical structure in a concise form. \\n            - Ensure that the simplified information maintains all logical relationships of the original statement. \\n            - The number of \"Simplified Statement\", \"List Objects\", \"List Actions\" and \"List Instances\" must be equal to the number of questions statement. \"List Objects\", \"List Actions\" and \"List Instances\" number i is infered from corresponding \"Simplified Statement\" number i.\\n            - \"List Objects\" contains the event of the statement, usually a noun. \"List Actions\" contains the action on the event of the statement, usually a verb, adjective, comparison symbols, etc. \"List Instances\" is the instance of the object, it is proper noun: a word that refers to a specific name of a person, place, thing, idea or sometime a number, etc.\\n            - \"Simplified Statement\", \"List Objects\", \"List Actions\" are must have sections.\\n        You can add \"Important Infomation\" items if you think there is some information that is important but is not appropriate to parallel with the Logical Statements.\\n        Reminder:\\n            - Each \"Simplified Statement\" derive 3 sections \"List Objects\", \"List Actions\", \"List Instances\". If there is no instance in the corresponding statement, return \"List Instances is:\" \"No Instance\".\\n            - \"List Instances\" is only and always only its corresponding statement, not all the statements\\' context.\\n            - Always recheck the answer for each item in each category \"List Objects\", \"List Actions\" and \"List Instances\", this is the Python code:\\n                ### Python function to check the item in each category is validated:\\n                def check_item_validated(category, simplified_statement):\\n                    for item in category.split(\",\"):\\n                        if item in simplified_statement:\\n                            return True\\n                        else:\\n                            while(item not in simplified_statement):\\n                                item = regenerate_item(item)\\n        \\n        Examples:\\n            Simplified Statement 1: Marco and Alice enroll to seminar final, they got accepted for tutor\\n            List Objects 1: seminar, tutor\\n            List Actions 1: enroll, accepted\\n            List Instances 1: Marco, Alice\\n            ###\\n\\n            Simplified Statement 2: Choosing a major requires ≥ 30 credits, GPA ≥ 2.5 (scale 0-4), ≤ 2 violations; second-year status (≥ 24 credits).\\n            List Objects 2: major, credits, GPA, violations, second-year status\\n            List Actions 2: choosing, ≥, ≤\\n            List Instances 2: 30, 2.5, 2, 24\\n            ###\\n\\n            Simplified Statement 3: A student can withdraw up to 2 courses per semester if remaining credits ≥ 12; each withdrawal reduces GPA by 0.1 (scale 0-10).\\n            List Objects 3: courses, semester, credits, withdrawal, GPA\\n            List Actions 3: can withdraw, remaining, reduces, ≥, ≤, \\n            List Instances 3: 2, 12, 0.1\\n            ###\\n\\n            Simplified Statement 4: If a student cannot teach, then they lack a research foundation.\\n            List Objects 4: research foundation\\n            List Actions 4: cannot teach, lack\\n            List Instances 4: No Instance\\n            ###\\n\\n\\n        ### Answer Response: \\n        Desired_format: \"\"\"\\n            Simplified Statement 1 || List Objects 1 || List Actions 1 || List Instances 1\\n            Simplified Statement 2 || List Objects 2 || List Actions 2 || List Instances 2\\n            ...

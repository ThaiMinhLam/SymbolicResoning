    "explanations": "- Step 1: From P1, we know that if a student is at the university, has completed the core curriculum, and passed the science assessment, then they qualify for something.\n           - Step 2: From P5, we know that having an award honor diploma and completing community service makes a student qualify for a scholarship.\n           - Step 3: From P6, we know that Sophia has completed the research methodology course.\n           - Step 4: From P7, we know that Sophia has completed her capstone project.\n           - Step 5: From P8, we know that Sophia's name is Sophia and she is a person.\n           - Step 6: From P10, we know that Sophia has completed community service.\nBased on the rationale, since Sophia is a student at the university (P8 and AtUniversity(Sophia)), she has completed the core curriculum and passed the science assessment (implied by P1), she has completed her research methodology course (HaComplete(Sophia, ResearchMethodologyCourse)), she has completed her capstone project (HaCompleteCapstoneProject(Sophia)), and she has completed community service (CompleteCommunityService(Sophia) and Selected Premises P5 and P10), she qualifies for the university scholarship according to P5."

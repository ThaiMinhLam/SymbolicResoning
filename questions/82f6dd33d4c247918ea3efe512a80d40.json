    "explanations": [
        "- Step 1: From P1, we know that if Sophia receives a scholarship and completes the core curriculum and prefers Science, then she qualifies for advanced courses. Since we know that Sophia receives a scholarship (from the given fact), and we also know that she prefers Science (given fact), we can infer that Sophia qualifies for advanced courses (P1).\n           - Step 2: From P2, we know that if Sophia receives a scholarship, qualifies for advanced courses, and completes research methodology, then she prefers the international program. Since we have already established that Sophia qualifies for advanced courses (from Step 1), and we know that she is at Sophia University where research methodology is likely a requirement (from P7), we can infer that Sophia prefers the international program (P2).\n           - Step 3: From P4, we know that if Sophia receives a scholarship and prefers the international program, then she is eligible for the international program. Since we have already inferred that Sophia prefers the international program (from Step 2), we can conclude that she is eligible for the international program (P4).\nBased on the given premises and the inferences made from them, the strongest conclusion is that Sophia is eligible for the international program. This is because we were able to establish that Sophia prefers the international program (Step 2), and since the premises state that if Sophia receives a scholarship and prefers the international program, then she is eligible for the international program (P4), we can conclude that Sophia is indeed eligible for the international program."

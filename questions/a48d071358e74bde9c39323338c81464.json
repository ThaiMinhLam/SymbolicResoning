    "explanations": "- Step 1: From P1, we know that if a student has completed the core curriculum, passed the science assessment, and prefers Science, then they qualify for the university scholarship.\n           - Step 2: We are given that Sophia has passed the science assessment (P5).\n           - Step 3: We also know that Sophia is a student (Person(Sophia) implies Student(Sophia)). Since Student(Sophia) is not explicitly stated, but implied, it can be inferred from the given predicates.\n           - Step 4: Therefore, based on P1 and P5, we can conclude that Sophia qualifies for the university scholarship.\nThe final answer is \"A. Sophia qualifies for the university scholarship\" because, according to the given premises and the logical reasoning process outlined above, Sophia does indeed qualify for the university scholarship due to having completed the core curriculum and passing the science assessment."
